# Distribution Model

`master` branch is the development edge and contains all plugin distributions source.

`plugin/*` branches are individual plugin distribution branch. Contributions
should go into master branch first and built distribution checked into these branches. These
branches will be tagged with version.

`npm` module will contain all plugin distributions. If you only need individual plugin, please
reference it by git repo.

way, please open an issue.
